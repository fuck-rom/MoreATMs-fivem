Adds more ATms to the map!

Why this map???????????????????????????????
- Well over the year or so I have played fivem I have accumalated around 2,000 hours... And played on loads of servers throughout the time, playing on ESX/QB (Economy) servers I have always realized the lack of availability to banking. Especially for new players who may not have a car or any way to go around the city other than walk. SO basically this .ymap adds more ATms around the map since most newer scripts run off prop hashes and not coordinates for easier money access by players!

DISCLAIMER:
- I did not have much time to do this so there is a only a couple in Southern Los Santos right now, although once I get more time eventually LS as a whole will have a bunch more as well as eventually all of Blaine County... So I just need the time - although you are permitted to add/remove atm locations as you wish, if you wanna add more or remove some for maps you may have.
